## Notes

[Page 1] The famous phrase “data is the new oil” has proven true. Just like oil, the value of data is in its potential after it’s refined and delivered to the consumer. Also like oil, it takes efficient pipelines to deliver data through each stage of its value chain.

[Page 2] Data pipelines are sets of processes that move and transform
data from various sources to a destination where new value can be derived. They are the foundation of analytics, reporting, and
machine learning capabilities. [...] Data engineers specialize in building and maintaining the data pipelines that underpin the analytics ecosystem.
